                The motherboard is the central component of a computer, responsible for connecting and integrating all the other components
                devices, allowing them to communicate with each other. It provides the electrical circuits and
                connectors necessary to interconnect the processor, RAM memory, hard drives, graphics cards
                expansion and other peripherals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the motherboard houses the chipset, which manages data traffic between the processor and
                other components. It also has the processor socket, memory slots, and expansion ports.
                (such as PCIe), which allow the installation of additional cards and storage devices, ensuring
                the expansion and customization of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The motherboard also contains the BIOS/UEFI, which boots the system and configures the hardware, as well as receiving
                power supply, distributing the necessary voltage to the components.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, the motherboard is the foundation of the computer, allowing all its components to work
                together, and their structure defines the compatibility and overall performance of the system.
