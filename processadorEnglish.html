                The computer processor (CPU) is responsible for executing the instructions of a program, being the
                "brain" of the system. It works in three main steps: fetch (gets instructions from memory),
                decoding (interprets the instruction) and execution (performs the requested operation).
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern processors are made up of millions of transistors that perform calculations and operations
                logics. Furthermore, they can have multiple cores, allowing you to perform multiple tasks at the same
                time, and
                memory caches, which store frequently accessed data to speed up performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two main processor architectures: RISC (fast and simple instruction set) and
                CISC (more complex and powerful instructions). Some technologies, such as Hyper-Threading and
                overclocking,
                further increase processor efficiency and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, the processor is crucial to the operation of the computer, quickly carrying out instructions and
                controlling the flow of data, with continuous advances to improve performance and efficiency.
