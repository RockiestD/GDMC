    <h1>Connecting storage devices</h1>
    <p>Connecting an HD (hard drive) or SSD (solid state drive) to the motherboard is an essential task when assembling or
        update a computer. </p><br>
    <p>
        Before you start, have at hand:<br><br>

        A screwdriver compatible with the case screws.<br>
        The SATA data cable (usually comes with the motherboard or disk).<br>
        The SATA power cable (part of the computer's power supply).<br>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        HD or SSD: Locate the device that will be installed. HDDs are generally larger and heavier, while
        SSDs have smaller form factors (2.5", M.2 or NVMe).<br>
        SATA port: For 2.5" or 3.5" HDs and SSDs, you will need to connect a SATA cable. These doors are in
        motherboard and are generally identified as "SATA 1", "SATA 2", etc.<br>
        M.2 port: If the SSD is of the M.2 type, it will be connected directly to an M.2 slot on the motherboard.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Position and connect cables</h2><br><br>
    <h3>For SATA HDs or SSDs</h3>
    <p>Mount the device in the case:<br>
        Use the appropriate screws to fix the HD or SSD in the specific compartment of the case.<br>
        Connect the SATA data cable:<br>
        Insert one end of the SATA cable into the HD or SSD port and the other end into the SATA port on the motherboard.<br>
        Connect the power cord:<br>
        Take a SATA connector from the power supply and connect it to the HD or SSD.<br>
        Organize cables:<br>
        Use clips or cable ties to keep cables organized and out of the way.</p><br>

    <h3>For M.2 SSDs</h3>
    <p>
        Locate the M.2 slot on the motherboard:<br>
        The slot can be next to the processor or between the PCIe slots.<br>
        Remove the slot screw:<br>
        Loosen the small screw that holds the SSD in place.<br>
        Insert SSD:<br>
        Place the SSD into the slot at a 30Â° angle and gently press it down.<br>
        Fix the SSD:<br>
        Replace the screw to secure the SSD in place.<br>
