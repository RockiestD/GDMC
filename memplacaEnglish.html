        Placing the RAM memories on the motherboard
    </h1>
    <p>To install RAM memories on the motherboard, follow these steps:</p>
    <p>Prepare the environment: Make sure you are in a clean area and wear an anti-static wrist strap to prevent component damage.</p>
    <p>Align the RAM modules with the slots, watching the key to ensure they are inserted correctly.</p>
    <p>Insert the RAM modules into the slots with even pressure until you hear a "click", indicating that they have locked into place.</p>
    <p>Check that the RAM is securely seated and go to the next step.</p>
