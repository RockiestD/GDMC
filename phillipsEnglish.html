                The Phillips screwdriver is an essential tool for assembling computers, characterized by its
                cross-shaped tip. This type of wrench is designed to precisely fit screws of the same shape, providing
                greater control and preventing the screw from slipping or becoming damaged.

                When assembling computers, the Phillips screwdriver is used to fix various components. From the beginning,
                from fixing the motherboard to the case, to installing components such as power supplies
                power, coolers and graphics cards, it is indispensable, ensuring that everything is securely fastened and
                operate safely.

                There are different sizes of Phillips screwdrivers, usually identified by numbers (such as PH0, PH1 and
                PH2), which are used for screws of varying sizes. On computers, the PH1 or PH2 size is usually
                be the most common, but it's always good to have a good variety of sizes.

                Additionally, many Phillips screwdrivers used in PC assembly come with an ergonomic handle and material.

                Static electricity can damage sensitive electronic components.
