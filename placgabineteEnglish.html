        Placing the processor cooler on the motherboard
    </h1>
    <p>Placing the motherboard in the case is a simple process, but requires care. Here is a summary of the steps
        main:</p>
    <p>Choose a clean, flat surface to work on.<br>
        Wear an anti-static wrist strap or touch a metal surface regularly to avoid damage caused by
        static electricity.<br>
        Have a Philips screwdriver handy.</p>
    <p>Make sure the case is compatible with the motherboard size (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, etc.).<br>
        Remove the side panels of the case, usually secured by screws on the back.</p><br>

    <h2>Install the motherboard mirror</h2>
    <p>The I/O mirror (backplate) is the metal part that accompanies the motherboard and covers the rear ports.
        Fit the mirror into the corresponding space on the back of the cabinet. Press firmly until you hear a
        click.</p><br>

    <h2>Prepare the spacers</h2>
    <p>Locate the mounting points on the case and compare them to the holes on the motherboard.
        Install the spacers (small metal supports) on the case, aligning them with the holes on the motherboard. Those
        Spacers prevent the motherboard from coming into direct contact with the case.</p><br>

    <h2>Secure the motherboard and connect the front panel cables</h2>
    <p>Align the rear ports of the motherboard with the I/O mirror.<br>
        Carefully lower the motherboard into the case, making sure the holes line up with the standoffs.<br>
        Secure the motherboard with appropriate screws (usually supplied with the case), tightening them lightly to
        do not damage the board.<br>
        Connect the cables from the front panel of the case (such as the power button, LEDs, and USBs) to the
        corresponding ports on the
        motherboard. Consult your motherboard manual for the exact location.
    </p><br>
    <p>Make sure that the motherboard is securely fixed and that no metal parts are in direct contact with
        electronic components.
        Check that all screws are in place and that the cables are securely connected</p>
