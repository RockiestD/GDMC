    <h1>Turning on the computer for the first time</h1><br>

    <h2>Check all cables</h2><br>
    <p>Before turning on the computer, make sure all cables are properly connected. This includes:<br>

        Power cable from source to socket.<br>
        Power cable from power supply to motherboard and CPU.<br>
        SATA data cable (if using HDDs or SSDs) connected to the motherboard.<br>
        Video connections (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI) between the video card or motherboard and the monitor.<br>
        Front panel connections (power button, LEDs, USB, audio).</p><br>

    <h2>Check the components</h2><br>
    <p>Check that all components are well fitted and installed:<br>

        Motherboard: Check that the motherboard is correctly fixed in the case and that the cables are connected to the
        right places.<br>
        Processor (CPU): Make sure the cooler is securely attached to the processor.<br>
        RAM Memory: Check that the memory modules are securely seated in the appropriate slots.<br>
        Video card (if present): Make sure the video card is properly installed in the PCIe slot and that
        power cords (if necessary) are connected.<br>
        Storage devices: Check if the HD or SSD is correctly installed and connected.</p><br>

    <h2>Turn on the computer</h2><br>
    <p>Now that everything is checked, it's time to turn on the computer for the first time:<br>

        Press the power button on the case.<br>
        The computer should begin the boot process. You will see the LEDs light up and the fans start to
        rotate. The monitor screen can display POST (Power-On Self-Test) information, which is the power-on test.
