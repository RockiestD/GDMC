        Placing the video card on the motherboard
    </h1>
    <p>Placing the video card on the motherboard is a simple process, but requires care. Here is a summary of the steps
        main:</p>
    <p>Wear an anti-static wrist strap or touch a metal surface to discharge static electricity before
        handling the internal components.</p>
    <p>Then, locate the PCI-Express x16 slot on the motherboard. This is the largest slot and is where the video card
        will be installed. Most video cards use this type of slot.</p>
    <p>In order for the video card to have room to fit, you will need to remove one or more expansion caps on the
        rear of the cabinet. Remove the screws holding the cover and remove it. Normally, the lids are
        located just below the PCI-Express slot.</p>
    <p>Take the video card and align the gold connectors (PCI-Express) with the PCI-Express x16 slot on the motherboard.
        The graphics card is uniquely shaped, so it will only fit one way.
    </p>
    <p>With the card well aligned, carefully insert it into the PCI-Express slot. The plate should slide smoothly to the
        bottom
        of the slot.
        Apply light pressure to ensure the graphics card seats completely. You may hear a "click"
        when the video card is properly installed.</p>
    <p>Make sure your power supply is sufficient to support the video card. Most powerful cards
        require higher capacity power supplies.
        If your graphics card is large, check the available space in your case before purchasing to ensure it
        it fits.
        Drivers: After installation, always install the latest graphics card drivers to ensure the best
        performance and compatibility with games and software.</p>
