        Placing the processor on the motherboard
    </h1>
    <p>Placing the processor on the motherboard is a simple process, but requires care. Here is a summary of the main steps:</p>
    <p>Prepare the environment: Make sure you are in a clean area and wear an anti-static wrist strap to prevent component damage.</p>
    <p>Place the motherboard on a table.</p>
    <p>Lift the socket lever: The motherboard socket has a lever that must be lifted to make room for the processor.</p>
    <p>Align the processor: Check the alignment marker on the processor (a triangle or dot) and on the socket to ensure the processor is being placed in the correct position.</p>
    <p>Place the processor: With the processor aligned, gently place it into the socket. It should fit without forcing.</p>
    <p>Close the lever: Lower the lever to secure the processor in place.</p>
    <p>Apply thermal paste (if necessary): If the processor does not have thermal paste pre-applied, place a small amount on the chip.</p>
    <p><a href="coolerplacaEnglish.html">Install the cooler:</a> Place the cooler over the processor and secure it correctly to ensure adequate cooling.</p>
    <p>With this, the first step towards an assembled computer will be complete.</p>
