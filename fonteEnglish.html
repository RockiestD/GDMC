                Power supplies are essential components in electronic devices and electrical systems,
                responsible for converting energy from the electrical grid or other sources into levels appropriate for the
                equipment operation. They play the role of stabilizing and regulating voltage and current,
                ensuring connected devices operate efficiently and safely.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are different types of power supplies, each designed to meet specific needs.
                specific. Linear sources, for example, are known for their simplicity and low emission.
                noise, but they tend to be less efficient in terms of energy consumption. As for switched sources,
                widely used in modern electronics, they are more compact and efficient, converting energy with
                lower heat dissipation, although they can generate electromagnetic interference that requires filtering
                adequate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important aspect is the classification of power supplies in relation to the type of output
                provided. Direct current (DC) sources are widely used in devices such as computers,
                telephones and household appliances. On the other hand, alternating current (AC) sources are used in
                industrial equipment and larger household appliances that operate directly on grid power
                electrical.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to traditional applications, the growing demand for sustainability has driven the
                development of ecological power sources, such as those using solar energy or other renewable sources. As
                a result, innovation in this field not only improves energy efficiency, but also reduces environmental
                impact, becoming a key component in technological advancement and preservation of the planet.
