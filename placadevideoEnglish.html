                Video cards, or GPUs, are responsible for processing graphics and images displayed on the computer,
                making it easier to run games, videos and complex graphics applications. They perform the rendering
                images, relieving the CPU of this heavy task.
            </p>
            <p>
                By taking on this load, the GPU allows the CPU to focus on other system functions, providing
                faster, more fluid performance in activities that require intensive graphics processing, such as games
                and
                editing software.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GPU receives data from the CPU and processes it through multiple cores, allowing the creation of
                images
                detailed and fluid. It uses VRAM, a dedicated memory to store textures and other data
                graphics, which directly influences performance, especially at high resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>

                In addition to games, graphics cards are fundamental in areas such as artificial intelligence and
                simulations.
                scientific, due to its ability to perform calculations in parallel. Over time, GPUs have become
                more powerful and versatile, being essential for many current technologies.
