        computer works properly:</p><br>

    <h2>Motherboard drivers</h2>

        from the manufacturer's website.</p><br>

    <h2>Video Card Drivers</h2>
    <p>Video card drivers (if you have one): If you are using a dedicated graphics card, download and install the drivers
    latest directly from the video card manufacturer's website (NVIDIA or AMD).</p><br>

    <h2>Operating system updates</h2>
    <p>Operating system updates: Run Windows Update or your operating system update to ensure that
