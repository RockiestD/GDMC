    <h1>Connecting the cables</h1><br>

    <h2>Power supply cable (PSU)</h2>
    <p>Power supply cable: The main cable coming from the power supply (PSU) must be connected to the power outlet
        power supply or a surge protector/line filter.<br>
        PSU power cable to motherboard: Locate the 24-pin connector (usually the largest connector) on the
        power supply and connect it to the motherboard, on the 24-pin power connector.<br>
        CPU Connector (4/8-pin): The power supply also has a 4- or 8-pin cable (depending on your motherboard) for
        power the CPU. Connect it to the CPU power connector on the motherboard.</p><br>

    <h2>SATA cables (For HD, SSD and Optical Drives)</h2>
    <p>SATA data cable: Connect a SATA cable from the motherboard to each storage drive (HD or SSD). The connectors
        SATA on the motherboard are usually located near the right edge.<br>
        SATA power cable: Connect a SATA power cable from the power supply to the storage drives. THE
        source must have specific connectors for this, generally black and flat.</p><br>

    <h2>Connect the Video Cable (To Video Card or Monitor)</h2>
    <p>Dedicated graphics card (GPU): If you are using a dedicated graphics card, insert the video cable (HDMI,
        DisplayPort, DVI, or VGA) from your GPU to the corresponding port on the monitor.<br>
        Integrated video (if not using a dedicated video card): If you are using the motherboard's integrated video,
        connect
        the video cable directly into the video output port on the motherboard (usually located on the back of the
        computer)
        cabinet).<br>
        If your video card requires additional power (via 6 or 8 pins), connect the power supply cable
        power cables to the corresponding connectors on the graphics card.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Connect the Front Panel Cables (Power Button, USB, LEDs, etc.)</h2>
    <p>Power button: The power button cable (usually marked "Power Switch") must be connected to the
        "PWR_SW" connector on the motherboard.<br>
        Front Panel LEDs: If your case has LEDs to indicate power or HDD status, connect the cables
        LED connector to the corresponding connector ("PWR_LED", "HDD_LED") on the motherboard.<br>
        USB ports: Connect the USB cables from the front panel of the case to the USB connectors on the motherboard.
        They normally
        They have 9 pins and are clearly identified.<br>
        Front panel audio: Connect the front panel audio cable to the "HD_AUDIO" connector on the motherboard.</p><br>

    <h2>Connect the Cooling Cables (Coolers and Fans)</h2>
    <p>Case fans: Connect the case fan cables to the "CHA_FAN" or "SYS_FAN" connectors on the
        motherboard.<br>
        Processor fan (CPU): The processor fan cable must be connected to the "CPU_FAN" connector on the
        motherboard.</p><br>

    <h2>Connect the Network Cable (Ethernet)</h2>
    <p>If you are using a wired connection, connect an Ethernet cable to your computer's network port and the other
        end on the router or network switch.</p>
