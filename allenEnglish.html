                The Allen key, also known as the hexagonal wrench, is a simple but very useful tool,
                especially in the assembly and maintenance of computers. It is characterized by its L-shape and
                have ends with a hexagonal cross section, designed to fit screws with heads
                hexagonal.

                When assembling computers, the Allen key is often used to secure components with
                specific screws, such as some cabinet models that use hexagonal screws for safety
                and aesthetics. Additionally, it is common for CPU coolers, liquid cooling systems, and even some
                More robust video cards come with hexagonal screws for greater stability.

                Unlike the Phillips screwdriver, the Allen screwdriver offers an alternative way of tightening, providing
                excellent torque while at the same time being less likely to wear the screw head, which is ideal
                for components that may need to be removed and replaced. Have a set of Allen wrenches
                different sizes is a good practice for those who assemble computers, as it guarantees the ability to meet
                to a variety of components and situations.
