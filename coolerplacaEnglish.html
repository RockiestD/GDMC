        Placing the processor cooler on the motherboard
    </h1>
    <p>Placing the cooler on the motherboard is a simple process, but requires care. Here is a summary of the steps
        main:</p>
    <p>Make sure you have the cooler box, the processor (CPU) already installed on the motherboard and that the thermal paste
        is applied (if it is not pre-applied to the cooler)<br>
        Check your motherboard manual to locate the cooler power connector (usually marked
        "CPU_FAN").</p>
    <p>If the cooler does not have thermal paste pre-applied, apply a small amount (the size of a grain of rice)
        in the center of the processor. This paste helps transfer heat from the CPU to the cooler.</p>
    <p>Align the retaining pins or screws on the cooler box with the holes around the CPU socket on the motherboard.<br>
        Make sure the cooler is correctly oriented so that the power cable easily reaches the "CPU_FAN" connector.</p><br>
    <h2>Attaching the cooler to the motherboard</h2>
    <p>For systems with push pins (such as Intel):<br><br>

        Press each pin down until it clicks, alternating between opposite sides (in an "X") to ensure even fixation.<br>
        Make sure all pins are securely seated.<br><br>

        For systems with screws (such as AMD or some Intel models):<br><br>
        
        Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws on the motherboard brackets.
        Tighten the screws crosswise ("X") to apply even pressure.
        </p><br>
    
    <h2>Connect the power cord</h2>
        
    <p>Locate the "CPU_FAN" connector on the motherboard and connect the cooler box cable.<br>
        Make sure the connector is securely seated, as it supplies power to the cooler.
    </p>
    <p>Confirm that the cooler is securely attached and does not move when lightly touched.<br>
        Make sure the cooler's power cable is not obstructing the fan or other parts.</p>
