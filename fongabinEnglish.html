    <h1>Placing the power supply in the cabinet</h1><br>
    <p>
        Installing the power supply (PSU) in the case is one of the initial steps in assembling a computer.<br>
        For this:<br>
        Work on a flat, clean, static-free surface.<br>
        Wear an anti-static wrist strap or regularly touch a grounded metal surface.<br>
        Make sure the cabinet is open and ready for installation.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2>Identify the position of the source</h2>
    <p>
        Check the designated location for the power supply on the case, which is usually at the bottom back (mostly
        of modern cabinets) or at the top back (on older models).<br><br>
        Observe the ventilation space:<br>
        If the case has openings or filters at the bottom, position the power supply fan downwards.<br>
        Otherwise, position the fan upwards, pointing into the case.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2>Prepare and install the font</h2>
    <p>
        Check that the source is in the correct voltage mode (110V or 220V) according to the outlet used to supply
        power to the PC, if it is not automatic bivolt.<br>
        Organize the source cables to facilitate later connection.<br>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Position the power supply: Place it in the appropriate bay, aligning the screw holes on the back of the
        cabinet.<br>
        Secure the power supply: Use the screws provided with the power supply or case to secure it to the case. Normally, they are
        four screws positioned in the corners.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2>Organize and connect cables (optional)</h2>
    <p>
        Before connecting cables to the motherboard and other components, organize them for easier management and maintenance.
        adequate airflow within the case.<br>
        Use clips or cable ties to secure the cables, if necessary.
    </p><br>
    <p>Although connecting the cables can be done later, you can take advantage of this moment to connect the power
        main to the motherboard, CPU, GPU and other devices.</p><br>
